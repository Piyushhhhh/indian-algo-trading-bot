# Indian Algo Trading Bot

This project is a best-in-class algorithmic trading bot designed for Indian stocks. The bot will fetch live and historical data, analyze it using advanced strategies, and execute trades via Indian broker APIs.

## Features (Planned)
- Fetch historical and real-time data for Indian stocks
- Plug-and-play trading strategies (momentum, mean reversion, ML-based, etc.)
- Integration with broker APIs (e.g., Zerodha Kite, Angel One)
- Backtesting and performance analytics
- Robust error handling, logging, and reporting

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Configure your broker API credentials
3. Run the starter bot: `python main.py`

## Next Steps
- Implement your first trading strategy in `strategies/`
- Set up broker API integration in `broker/`
- Add backtesting modules
